----------

The controller first choose a direction upon two conditions
1) The closest regular pill
2) The closest edible ghost
If no edible ghost is closer than 0.2(magical number) 
  go pill
else 
  go eat ghosts

Then, determine if there is a threat(by my definition, explained next), change to a direction contains no threat.

Threat is defined: distance to junction and distance between ghost and Ms.Pacman is lower than 0.02.

*Put isThreat(), which contains another loop of 4, after first determine the direction since performing better for unknown reason
